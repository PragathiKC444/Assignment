# Round 1: Coding and Data Analysis Task

## Task Overview
Select a recent research paper (IEEE, Springer, SCI journal) in data science, machine learning, image processing, neural networks, deep learning, or your area of interest. Complete the following:

- Develop a unique solution or improvement based on the paper.
- Implement the solution with original code.
- Prepare a comprehensive document including:
  - Literature Review
  - Proposed Algorithm (steps, architecture)
  - Research Questions and Objectives
  - Visualizations (screenshots of outputs)
  - Comparative Analysis (existing vs. proposed)
- Submit code and document as a ZIP file (plagiarism-free, well-commented).
- Submit a video presentation (up to 15 min) covering novelty, literature review, implementation, visualizations, analysis, and presentation quality.

## Case Study Preparation
- Problem Statement and Objectives
- Data Preprocessing steps
- Model Selection and Development
- Visualizations and Insights
- Recommendations
- Submit as PDF with code files and a 15-min video.

## Journal Selection (Stage-1)
- Suggest 5 cost-effective journals (3 Q2, 2 Q3, priority from references)
- References must be Scopus-indexed, SCI journals, no conference journals, all with DOI
- Minimum 25+ references
- Some references from suggested journals
- Finalize journal priority and reference list before draft

## Draft Paper Guidelines
- Discuss datasets, methodologies, existing codes/models, comparisons, time/space complexity
- Finalize algorithm steps and name
- Cross-validation, feature selection, accuracy
- Balanced/unbalanced dataset performance
- Visualize results
