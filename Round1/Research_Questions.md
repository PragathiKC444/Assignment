# Research Questions and Objectives

## Research Questions
1. Can attention mechanisms improve road segmentation accuracy in deep learning models?
2. How does the proposed model perform on balanced vs. unbalanced datasets?
3. What are the comparative results against standard U-Net and DeepLab architectures?

## Objectives
- Develop an improved U-Net-based model with attention blocks for road detection.
- Evaluate the model on the Massachusetts Roads Dataset.
- Compare performance with existing algorithms using IoU, F1-score, and accuracy.
- Visualize segmentation results and performance metrics.
